# The application domain
The term *application domain* refers to the 'realm of business logic' for which the application is responsible. It is *not to be confused with **Internet domains*** such as `example.com`. The origins of this term come from a technique called **Domain Driven Design**.

It is helpful to developers when types and methods are named using terms from the application domain.
